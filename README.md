# read-csv-rust

This Rust project demonstrates how to read data from a CSV file using the `csv` crate and handle errors. It provides a basic structure for reading and printing CSV data to the terminal.

## Usage

### Installation

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If not, you can install them from [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

### Clone the Repository

You can clone this repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codescalper/read-csv-rust.git
```

### Build and Run

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd read-csv-rust
```

Build and run the project with Cargo:

```bash
cargo run
```

The program will attempt to read the data from the `Sample.csv` file in the project directory and print it to the terminal. Make sure to replace `Sample.csv` with your own CSV file if needed.

## Importance

This project serves as a starting point for working with CSV files in Rust. It demonstrates how to use the `csv` crate to read and process CSV data, making it useful for developers looking to handle CSV files in their Rust applications.

## Where to Use

1.  **Data Processing**: This project can be used as a foundation for developing Rust applications that need to read, process, and manipulate CSV data.
2.  **Data Import and Export**: It can be integrated into applications that involve importing data from CSV files or exporting data to CSV format.

For more information on using the `csv` crate, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.rs/csv).
